I  completed a Hand Gesture Recognition project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras. This system recognizes 10 different hand gestures, including "palm," "fist," "thumbs-up," and more, leveraging the Leap GestRecog dataset.

ðŸ”‘ Key features:

Preprocessing: Grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization, and one-hot encoding.
CNN Architecture:
32 and 64 filters for convolution layers.
Max Pooling and Dropout layers for optimization.
Dense layers with a final softmax activation for classification.
Evaluation: Achieved strong accuracy with categorical cross-entropy loss and RMSprop optimizer.
Results: Achieved a test accuracy of 99.97%, visualizing training and validation loss across epochs.
Excited to be learning and growing through this hands-on experience!
